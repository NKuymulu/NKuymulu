I'm Nevzat, currently studying electrical and electronics engineering. As a senior year student, I will try to learn how to code (especially in Python) 
which is a goal I wanted to accomplish for years.

//10.06.2022 - The first day of my Python bootcamp. My only experience in coding is with C, which was mandatory for my "Introduction to Programming" lecture. I used MATLAB
before on various projects, too.
